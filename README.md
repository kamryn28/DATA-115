# Adoption of Genetically Engineered Crops in the U.S.

## Motivation
Over the last twenty years, biotechnology has drastically improved and the capabilities of genomics has expanded greatly. I am pursuing a degree in Agricultural Biotechnology so I was interested in looking at how the use of genetically engineered crops has changed over time. The three main genetically engineered crops in the U.S. include corn, soybean and upland cotton. Although there are other types of genetically engineered crops grown and sold in the U.S., I was only able to discover data involving the three most commonly grown GMO crops from the <a href="https://www.usda.gov/content/usda-open-data-catalog">USDA Open Data Catalog</a>.  Other GMO's grown in the U.S. are less significant since they are grown in relatively small numbers.

## Data Source
The USDA collected data from 2000-2020 about the use of insect-resistant and herbicide-tolerant varieties of corn, soybean and cotton. The <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/adoption-of-genetically-engineered-crops-in-the-us.aspx">Adoption of Genetically Engineered Crops in the U.S.</a> dataset helped me to answer some questions I had about GMO use.  The data was collected by USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS).
