# Adoption of Genetically Engineered Crops in the U.S.

## Motivation
Over the last twenty years, biotechnology has drastically improved and the capabilities of genomics has expanded greatly.  I am pursuing a degree in Agricultural Biotechnology so I was interested in looking at how the use of genetically engineered crops has changed over time.  The three main genetically engineered crops in the U.S. include corn, soybean and upland cotton.  Although there are other types of genetically engineered crops grown and sold in the U.S., I was only able to discover data involving the three most commonly grown GMO crops.  <a href="https://www.usda.gov/content/usda-open-data-catalog">USDA Open Data Catalog</a>
